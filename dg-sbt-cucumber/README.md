Hello,

This is a WIP and really Not working example of Cucumber Sbt project. You have been warned it is not really working or even finished, anyway you can still copy it. It has been directly inspired by http://rubygemtsl.com/2014/08/01/scala-sbt-cucumber-and-selenium-webdriver/

you can test the project with this command: sbt test

Cheers,
David
