Hello,

This is a Work in progress and really Not working example of a Cucumber Sbt project. It has been directly inspired by
- http://rubygemtsl.com/2014/08/01/scala-sbt-cucumber-and-selenium-webdriver/
- http://www.sebnozzi.com/82/cucumber-and-play/

You have been warned it is not really working or even finished, anyway you can still clone it or download it if you want.

you can test the project with this command: sbt test

Cheers,
David
